**Title:**
**Structural Rupture of Solvability in Nonlinear Elliptic Systems under Extreme Metric Anisotropy**
**(極端度量各向異性下非線性橢圓系統可解性的結構性斷裂)**

**Abstract:**
In the numerical construction of relativistic initial data, coordinate transformations used to map infinite domains often introduce high metric anisotropy (stretching factors ). Conventional wisdom suggests that numerical difficulty scales linearly with anisotropy. This study demonstrates that solvability is not a continuous variable but exhibits a discrete phase transition. We identify a "Structural Rupture" point where the Jacobian's condition number exceeds the precision threshold of standard linearization techniques, causing the basin of attraction for Newton-Raphson methods to vanish. By analyzing the spectral properties of the linearized operator, we show that this failure is driven by the indefiniteness of the Hamiltonian constraint in high-stretching regimes. We propose that solvability can only be recovered by embedding the static boundary value problem into a pseudo-transient dynamic framework, effectively regularizing the ill-conditioned spectrum.

### **1. Introduction (引言)**

**1.1 The Problem Class (問題歸類)**
We consider the class of semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form:



where  is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a curved manifold, and  is a nonlinear source term. This form encompasses the Hamiltonian constraint in General Relativity, as well as reaction-diffusion equations in biological modeling.

**1.2 The Anisotropy Hypothesis (各向異性假設)**
When computational grids are stretched to resolve multi-scale features (e.g., near black hole horizons), the metric tensor  becomes highly anisotropic. The prevailing assumption in the community is that such deformations merely increase the truncation error or slow down convergence.

**1.3 The Main Thesis (核心論點)**
We argue that extreme anisotropy () triggers a fundamental change in the problem's structure. It is not merely a quantitative increase in error, but a qualitative loss of local convexity in the optimization landscape. This leads to a phenomenon we term **"Trust Region Collapse,"** where the validity radius of linear approximations falls below the machine precision noise floor.

### **2. Mathematical Framework (數學框架)**

**2.1 The Stretched Laplacian Model**
Consider a 1D model problem on a domain mapped by a function  with stretching factor . The Laplacian transforms as:



As , the dominant second-derivative term is suppressed by .

**2.2 The Indefiniteness Trap (不定性陷阱)**
In General Relativity, the source term  often contains a "mass term" with a negative derivative (e.g., ).
The linearized operator (Jacobian) is:



where  is the geometric operator and  is the mass matrix.
**Critical Insight:** When  is large,  becomes numerically insignificant compared to . If  is positive (negative curvature contribution), the total Jacobian  becomes **negative definite** or **indefinite**.
Standard Newton-Krylov solvers, which assume the operator retains the elliptic character of the Laplacian, interpret this indefiniteness as a descent direction flip, leading to divergence.

### **3. Phenomenology of Rupture (斷裂的現象學)**

Based on extensive numerical experiments (independent of specific solver implementations), we categorize the solvability regimes into three phases:

* **Phase I: The Newtonian Regime ()**
The Jacobian is diagonally dominant. Standard Newton-Raphson methods converge quadratically. The spectral gap is large.
* **Phase II: The Stagnation Plateau ()**
The condition number worsens. The linearized step  produces residuals that oscillate. Line search (backtracking) is required but sufficient to maintain stability.
* **Phase III: The Structural Rupture ()**
The "trust region" of the Newton step shrinks to zero. The linearized direction is dominated by high-frequency numerical noise rather than physical gradients. At this stage, static iterative methods (Picard, Newton) theoretically fail to converge to the physical solution without global regularization.

### **4. Theoretical Resolution: Dynamic Regularization (理論解決方案：動態正則化)**

To bridge the rupture, we must abandon the static formulation  and adopt a dynamic view. We introduce a homotopy parameter  (pseudo-time):



Discretization leads to a diagonally shifted operator:


**4.1 Spectral Repair (譜修復)**
The term  acts as a spectral shift. Even if the original Jacobian  has zero or negative eigenvalues (due to high ), the shifted operator  can be forced to be positive definite by choosing sufficiently large  (small ).

**4.2 The Solvability Corridor (可解性走廊)**
We propose that the only way to solve equations in Phase III is to traverse a specific trajectory in the  phase space. The solver must start with high  (diffusion-dominated regime) to smoothen grid-induced noise, and only relax  (Newtonian regime) once the solution has entered the extremely narrow basin of attraction of the physical root.

### **5. Numerical Evidence (數值證據)**

We analyze the convergence behavior of a Hamiltonian constraint model on a logarithmically stretched grid.

* **Fig 2:** Eigenvalue spectrum of the Jacobian at the horizon. Showing the migration of eigenvalues towards the negative half-plane as  increases.

### **6. Implications for High-Precision Physics (對高精度物理的啟示)**

**6.1 Beyond "Better Guess"**
It is often argued that divergence can be fixed by a "better initial guess." Our analysis suggests that in Phase III, the basin of attraction is so small that finding a suitable initial guess is computationally harder than solving the problem itself.

**6.2 The Necessity of Globalization**
For future high-resolution simulations (e.g., extreme mass-ratio inspirals) where  may exceed 100, "globalization" strategies like Pseudo-Transient Continuation are not optional enhancements but mathematical necessities. The discrete nature of solvability requires solvers that can seamlessly switch between parabolic (diffusive) and elliptic (Newtonian) characters.

### **Addendum: Relativity Beyond Physics — On the Absence of Absolute Backgrounds in Mathematical Solvability**

The notion of *relativity* is often regarded as a concept confined to physics, introduced to replace the assumption of absolute spacetime with observer-dependent structures and invariant relations. However, the present work suggests that the deeper significance of relativity lies not in its physical formalism, but in its response to a more general condition: **the failure of absolute, global background structures in sufficiently complex systems**.

In the context of nonlinear constraint solving, particularly for highly anisotropic elliptic systems, an analogous breakdown occurs. Traditional static Newton-type solvers implicitly assume the existence of a globally well-defined solution manifold, locally accessible through linearization. Our results indicate that this assumption is not merely violated by poor conditioning or insufficient tuning, but can fail *structurally*: the solvability of the system itself becomes discontinuous across parameter regimes. In such cases, the notion of an “absolute” solution—one that exists independently of the chosen evolution or continuation path—ceases to be operational.

The introduction of pseudo-transient continuation reframes the problem in a manner structurally similar to relativistic reasoning. Rather than presuming a fixed global reference (a static solution), the solver operates within a **dynamical framework**, where solutions are *generated through evolution* and validated by invariant criteria (e.g., monotonic residual descent and constraint consistency). The emphasis shifts from identifying an absolute endpoint to maintaining coherence along an admissible path.

From this perspective, the method does not relativize mathematical truth itself, but rather **relativizes the conditions under which mathematical objects become accessible**. The equations remain exact; what changes is the recognition that their solvability is contingent on the chosen procedural frame. Just as physical events lack absolute simultaneity yet preserve invariant causal structure, nonlinear constraint solutions may lack absolute static realizability while preserving invariant dynamical feasibility.

This observation motivates a broader interpretation: *relativity is not exclusively a physical principle, but a structural response to the absence of absolute backgrounds*. Whenever a domain reaches sufficient nonlinearity, coupling, or self-reference, absolute global assumptions tend to fail, and must be replaced by relational or dynamical formulations. The present work situates pseudo-transient globalization as one such formulation within numerical analysis, highlighting a parallel between relativistic reasoning in physics and solvability-oriented reasoning in mathematics.
